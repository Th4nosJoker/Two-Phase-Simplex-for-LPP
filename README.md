# Two-Phase-Simplex-for-LPP
This project offers a concise implementation of the Two Phase Simplex method, a robust algorithm tailored for solving linear programming problems. It efficiently optimizes linear objective functions amidst linear equality and inequality constraints, especially beneficial for non-canonical formulations.
